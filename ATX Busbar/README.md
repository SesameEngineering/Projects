This project is a small PCb on which you plug a standard ATX PSU.

You can use it to power up OCP servers plugging it directly on the servers (Leopard V2, Tioga Pass and Yosemite V1) or using the busbar (Leopard V1, Bryce Canyon, Big Sur).

It can power up to 1kW.

It is also compatible with OCP Medusa cable to power up 3 servers at the same time.

On onboard LED indicates if power is on or not

Be careful when it is plugged not to touch directly the busbars. A plastic cover is used for safety
