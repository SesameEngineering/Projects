# GPU solutions

In those folders you can find the different ways to adapt GPU to OCP Leopard and OCP Tioga Pass servers

3 different GPUs have been tested :

* Nividia Tesla T4
* Nvidia Tesla K80
* Nvidia Tesla A40

Due to heavy power consumption for Tesla K80 and Tesla A40 (300W for each), some physical modifications have to be done on the servers. How to modify each servers will be explain

To prevent thermal problems, it is required to set up the fan speed to a certain speed (around 80%) at all time. Different ways to change fan speed depending on server and version will be explained
