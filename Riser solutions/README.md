# Riser Solutions

## Riser solutions for Leopard

### Riser 2 OU, 6x Oculink connector

On this riser we have 6 Oculink connector. Each connector is connected to 4 PCie lanes so we use the 24 PCie lanes available from Leopard server. This riser is used for storage solution since we can connect up to 6 U.2 form factor drives. A special cable, Oculink to U.2 has to be used to connect to each drives.

### Riser 2 OU, 1x connector PCIe x16 + 2x Oculink connector

On this riser we have 2 Oculink connector and one x16 PCIe connector. Each Oculink uses 4 PCIe lanes so in total we use the 24 PCIe lanes available from Leopard server. Oculink connectors can be connected to U.2 devices via a Oculink to U.2 cable. Any half length PCIe devices can be connected to the x16 PCIe connector (Ava Board, network card, HBA, small form factor GPUs, etc..).

### Riser 2 OU, 1x connector PCIe x8 + 4x Oculink connector

On this riser we have 4 Oculink connector and one x8 PCIe connector. Each Oculink uses 4 PCIe lanes so in total we use the 24 PCIe lanes available from Leopard server. Oculink connectors can be connected to U.2 devices via a Oculink to U.2 cable. Only x8 PCIe devices can be connected to the x8 PCIe connector.

### Riser 1 OU, 1x connector PCIe x16

This riser is for 1 OU form factor Leopard. There is only one x16 PCIe connector on it so we only use 16 PCIe lanes over the 24 PCIe lanes from Leopard server. Any half length PCIe devices can be connected to the x16 PCIe connector (Ava Board, network card, HBA, small form factor GPUs, etc..).

## Riser solutions for Tioga Pass

### Riser 2 OU, dual connector PCIe x16

This riser has been designed to provide riser to Tioga Pass servers. It has 2 x16 PCIe connectors so it uses the 32 PCIe lanes from Tioga Pass server. Any half length PCIe devices can be connected to the x16 PCIe connector (Ava Board, network card, HBA, small form factor GPUs, etc..). One full length GPU can be connector to the upper PCIe slot

### Riser 1 OU, 1x connector PCIe x16

This riser is for 1 OU form factor Tioga Pass. There is only one x16 PCIe connector on it so we only use 16 PCIe lanes over the 32 PCIe lanes from Tioga Pass server. Any half length PCIe devices can be connected to the x16 PCIe connector (Ava Board, network card, HBA, small form factor GPUs, etc..).
