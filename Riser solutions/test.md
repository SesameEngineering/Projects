## Riser solutions for Leopard

### Riser 2 OU, 6x Oculink connector

On this riser we have 6 Oculink connector. Each connector is connected to 4 PCie lanes so we use the 24 PCie lanes available from Leopard server. This riser is used for storage solution since we can connect up to 6 U.2 form factor drives. A special cable, Oculink to U.2 has to be used to connect to each drives.

### Riser 2 OU, 1x connector PCIe x16 + 2x Oculink connector

On this riser we have 2 Oculink connector and one x16 PCIe connector. Each Oculink uses 4 PCIe lanes so in total we use the 24 PCIe lanes available from Leopard server. Oculink connectors can be connected to U.2 devices via a Oculink to U.2 cable. Any half length PCIe devices can be connected to the x16 PCIe connector (Ava Board, network card, HBA, small form factor GPUs, etc..).
